 Use the calculator and main_calculator file not the .class. IF you open .class file, it will not open
DO NOT USE THE FILE WHERE IT SAYS "THIS IS THE FILE FOR YOUR CODE" USE THE FILE IF IT SAYS "CREATE CALCULATOR" OR "CREATE MAIN_CALCULATOR"
IF YOU OPEN THE WRONG FILE IT WILL SAY "VIEW RAW" WHICH IS NOT GOOD SO GO BACK AND CLICK THE OTHER FILES. 
Thank you!
